Overview
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project uses Scala on both the client and server side, as well as having
shared Scala sources used by both sides.

Using the same language for the full stack and having shared sources allows us
in this project allows for both the server-side and client-side to:
* Use the same exact validation logic,
* Share the RMI interface,
* Share dependency injection modules.

### Key technologies

Server-side:
* [Jersey](https://jersey.java.net/) on [Jetty](http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/)

Client-side:
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)

Shared:
* [Autowire](https://github.com/lihaoyi/autowire) for RMI
* [MacWire](https://github.com/adamw/macwire) for dependency injection
* [ScalaTest](http://www.scalatest.org/) for testing
